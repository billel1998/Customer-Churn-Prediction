# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest). The workflow covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning & preprocessing, and model training & evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

To simulate a business scenario, I also built an interactive Power BI dashboard that monitors churn risk. The dashboard includes:

- Overall KPIs (average churn probability, churn rate, customers at risk)

- Segment analysis (Contract type, Internet service, Payment method)

- Customer drilldown (high-risk customers highlighted)

- Revenue at risk estimation

This project combines technical machine learning skills with business insights, showing how data science can support real-world retention strategies.
